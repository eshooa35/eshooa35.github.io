               <h2>Engineering Project</h2>
               <p><i>For this project, I had to work with a team of three other individuals to create a robot that could walk a set distance and gather objects along the route.
                   The goal of our robot was to distinguish between trash and regular objects, grab the trash, and then transport it to its proper location.
                   Collaborated with a team to develop and program a robot capable of distinguishing between objects, grabbing trash, and transporting it to proper locations.
